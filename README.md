# GWAS-Prediction-IBD-T2D: Genetic Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains the complete codebase, data cleaning pipelines, and final reports for a project that utilizes Machine Learning (ML) and Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) data to predict genetic risk for two major diseases.

## 🎯 Project Goals

The primary goal of this project was to develop, implement, and benchmark predictive models for:

1.  **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)** Risk Prediction
2.  **Type II Diabetes (T2D)** Status Classification

## 📊 Key Performance Achievements

The project involved training and comparing four distinct machine learning algorithms. The final results demonstrate a robust predictive capability across both complex biomedical datasets.

| Metric | Best Performance | Model Achieved By |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Peak Predictive Accuracy** | **84%** | Logistic Regression (IBD Data) |
| **Peak Precision** | **83%** | Logistic Regression (IBD Data) |
| T2D Project Best Accuracy | 77% | Support Vector Machine (T2D Data) |
